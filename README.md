# Reddit Scraper

Looking around at my workspace, it's clear that a lot of my tech needed upgrades. So, I created a Reddit bot that would scrape the top posts of various subreddits and send back the results to me. 

Created in **Python** & accesses the **PRAW** Reddit API and the **smtplib** Python Library.

Since I was trying to find headphones, graphics cards, and micrphones, I would have the bot scrape subreddits like r/CanadianHardwareSwap, r/HardwareSwap, and r/AppleSwap, and if any keywords were to hit, the bot originally sent me an email of the listing. (Because of changes to Gmail's service in May 2022, this is not possible the way I had implemented it anymore)
